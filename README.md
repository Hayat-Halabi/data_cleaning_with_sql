Cleaning data using Structured Query Language

Attached below I have a raw dataset of global layoffs. As you can see within this datasets we can find duplicates, Null / missing values and unnecessary rows and columns.

Step one before making any changes to the original dataset, we must make a duplicate of the table and fill the values just in case any mistakes were to happen, its best practice to do so. I also went ahead and altered the original dataname to layoffs_raw just so its clear. As you can see below the new table is made and filled with values, now we can move on to the next steps.
